## 💬 About Me Beyond Research

### 🚣🏼‍♂️ Sports & Athletics
I was part of the **Georgia Tech varsity men's rowing team**. I have a passion for rowing, hiking, and various ball sports. Sports have taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance - qualities that translate well into research.

### 🎤 Music & Performance
I used to be a **vocalist in a band**, where we performed live music shows with more than **400 people** in the audience. Music has always been a creative outlet for me and helps balance the analytical side of my research work.

### 🎮 Gaming & Competition
I achieved **3rd place in the Intel Cup of CSGO in China** - demonstrating my competitive spirit and strategic thinking abilities that extend beyond academics.

### 🌟 Philosophy
