<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! I'm Cheng Wan, a second-year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Georgia Tech.

Prior to pursuing my Master's degree, I conducted research in the biomedical field at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Science ([SIAT, CAS](https://english.siat.ac.cn/)) supervised by Dr.[Dan Wu](https://www.bit-siat.com/en/index.php?s=/Show/index/cid/12/id/16.html) and Professor [Ye Li](http://www.bit-siat.com/en/index.php?s=/Show/index/cid/10/id/2.html), focusing on blood pressure measurement.

I have a strong interest in applying AI within the realm of biomedicine (**Healthcare**). My research interests revolve around the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, particularly in the domains of CV.

I am now a research assistant in HuLab at [HuLab](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/initiatives/center-for-data-science) at [Emory](), still research on biomedical engineer area supervised by [Cheng Ding]([https://www.nursing.emory.edu/initiatives/center-for-data-science](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-staff/ran-xiao)) and [Xiao Hu](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-staff/xiao-hu). 

I am enthusiastic about further exploring these areas and enhancing my expertise. If you're interested in connecting, please feel free to contact me at **c.wan@gatech.edu**.

For more details, you can view my [Curriculum Vitae](pdfs/mycv.pdf).

I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position!
