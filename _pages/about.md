<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! I'm Cheng Wan, a first-year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Georgia Tech.

Prior to pursuing my Master's degree, I conducted research in the biomedical field at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Science ([SIAT, CAS](https://english.siat.ac.cn/)) supervised by Dr.[Dan Wu](https://www.bit-siat.com/en/index.php?s=/Show/index/cid/12/id/16.html) and Professor [Ye Li](http://www.bit-siat.com/en/index.php?s=/Show/index/cid/10/id/2.html), focusing on blood pressure measurement.

I have a strong interest in applying AI within the realm of biomedicine. My research interests revolve around the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, particularly in the domains of CV and NLP.

I am now a research assistant in HuLab at [HuLab](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/initiatives/center-for-data-science) at [Emory](), still research on biomedical engineer area supervised by [Cheng Ding](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/initiatives/center-for-data-science) and Professor [Xiao Hu](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-staff/xiao-hu). 

I am enthusiastic about further exploring these areas and enhancing my expertise. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me! If you're interested in connecting, please feel free to contact me at **c.wan@gatech.edu**.

For more details, you can view my [Curriculum Vitae](pdfs/mycv.pdf).
