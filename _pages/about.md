Hi there! I'm a first-year ECE Ph.D. Student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), previously working on Computer Vision at [CMU CS](), also on AI for Healthcare at [Georgia Tech]() and [Emory]().

My research is focused on AI for Medicine especially in 3D vision learning and understanding.

If you're interested at anything, please feel free to contact me at: jouiney666 at gmail dot com.
