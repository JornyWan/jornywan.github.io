Hi there! I'm a first-year ECE Ph.D. Student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), and I'm honored to be advised by [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/) and [Qingyu Zhao](https://mini-cornell.github.io/members/qingyu-zhao.html), previously working on Computer Vision at CMU CS, also on AI for Healthcare at Georgia Tech and Emory.

My research is now mainly focused on **AI for Medicine** especially in 3D vision learning and understanding. I'm passionate about developing intelligent systems that can make a meaningful impact in healthcare.
